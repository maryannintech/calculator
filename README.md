# Project: Calculator

This is the last project on the foundation course of The Odin Project, a calculator with a working addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions. This calculator only calculates one operation at a time, but I'm planning to get back to it and chain multiple operations as soon as I can (and try to do the extra credit). While I was doing this project, I realize that there are still so much to learn but I'm excited to continue this learning journey! ✌️
